            <h2>Form Design</h2>
            <p>
                After reading the article, I learned what to be extra careful when it comes to design a user interface and integrated it into my web development project. When it comes to getting user information, the user interface might easily be redundant, for example, providing heavy tasks for users to complete. However, the input area should be as brief and specific as possible to shorten the time for the user and maximize efficiency. What’s more, the content design of the web should be consistent as well, and good practice is to avoid making the web page into a newspaper, but visually relaxing and clear design by taking the advantage of the one-column design. 
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Another thing I learned after reading the article is that the design of a web page should always emphasize efficiency and user friendly, this refers that the fields should be noted concisely regarding their purposes, and their functionality: like giving hints to users about what is required and what isn’t, give a clear and explanation about what user is supposed to do in order to reach certain purposes, using color, labels, place holder, etc. All in all, the design should be intuitive and visually relaxing, and efficient in helping users reach their purpose in no time. All of these should be the foundation of design forms.
