            <h2>Modal Window</h2>
            <p>After reading “Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows” by Naema Baskanderi, I understood more about how and when to use a Modal Window while making a website. The main purposes of Modal Window are trying to get user attention and input, and show additional information with or without context. I think the important part of a Modal Window is having the correct size that is friendly for users to use, which is not too small nor too big that gives a hard time for the users to find out how to put their information in. Even though modal windows might not be favored by users while they see it since it is always asking personal information, it is necessary for a company or shopping website to have for economic purposes. Therefore, as designers, it is important for us to create a user-friendly modal window.</p>

            <h2>Form Design</h2>
            <p>
                After reading the article, I learned what to be extra careful when it comes to design a user interface and integrated it into my web development project. When it comes to getting user information, the user interface might easily be redundant, for example, providing heavy tasks for users to complete. However, the input area should be as brief and specific as possible to shorten the time for the user and maximize efficiency. What’s more, the content design of the web should be consistent as well, and good practice is to avoid making the web page into a newspaper, but visually relaxing and clear design by taking the advantage of the one-column design.

                Another thing I learned after reading the article is that the design of a web page should always emphasize efficiency and user friendly, this refers that the fields should be noted concisely regarding their purposes, and their functionality: like giving hints to users about what is required and what isn’t, give a clear and explanation about what user is supposed to do in order to reach certain purposes, using color, labels, place holder, etc. All in all, the design should be intuitive and visually relaxing, and efficient in helping users reach their purpose in no time. All of these should be the foundation of design forms.
