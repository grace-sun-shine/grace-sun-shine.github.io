            </section>

            <p>
                This site I found about presenting artworks is super well designed. The content that shared with my project is how it shift to the next site after clicking on a button, and the hovering animation is really cool with how the button was moving with the mouse. In addition, the background switching animation is really impressive with the melting effect, and I think the interface that was chosen is really connect to the theme.  I think the part that can be improved is that the words and button also disappear after the background changes that has few moment that the user cannot do anything on the site which affect the using experience.

            </section>

            <p>
                This website inspired me a lot about the game madlib since I did not know what was madlib at first. I think it was nicely designed to show different topics can be for the madlib game, and how we can design the input. The position of each section is really clear that user will know which to choose to open for the topic they want to experience about. In addition, the place that user was supposed to input is clearly instruct that is easy to understand. However, the website does not support the ability of actually creating a madlib but only for showing the starting of input the first word, and you cannot even type in.

            <p>
                The goal of my project is to create a user-friendly madlib website that the users can enter random information to receive an “Admission Letter” from Hogwarts. Compare with the original design, the final project will have a more immersive experience that it lead one by one the next page. Different for the above two Comparison Projects, my project will have button that transit back and forth between the input words and have a popup window to present the admission letter. To take advantage of the two Comparison Projects, I will learn the animation style and import to my project.

            </section>

            <p>
                The overall look of my project will stay similar to my original idea with the dark blue background because I think dark blue has a feeling of mystery and magic. However, the design of the admission letter will be updated to be affected by the color of the houses that the user chose. I will also take advantage of the contrast element from the design principle in my project to make the input stand out. In addition, I will also pay attention to the proportion to create the propriate focus for my website.
