            <p>
                Overall, the users feel confident that the direction that guided through the page is easy to follow, and it is easy to go back to fix the mistake that they make in the earlier page. However, there are some significant observations that they realized while testing which can improve the website:
            </p>          
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The first thing that two of my users mentioned is that on the finished page, I have put a close corner button as well as a quit button at the same time which does the same things. However, this caused destruction since the users were confused if they do different things but eventually they all load the page.  
                </li>
                <img src="images/result1.jpg" alt="result1">
                <li>
                    The color scheme of the input page could be something more neutral because the blue color is too similar to Ravenclawâ€™s color that they did not even notice the difference until they tried out the other houses
                </li>
                <img src="images/result2.jpg" alt="result1">
                <li>
                    The style of the dropdown select button can be improved to match the whole theme better.
                </li>
                <img src="images/result3.jpg" alt="result1">
            </ul>

                <h2>How To Improve</h2>
            </section>

            <p>
                I will update my prototype by removing the corner selection button and increase the size of the restart button on the finished site. And search what is the color scheme of Hogwarts to use the main page. In the end, if I have time, I will try to figure out how to revise the style of the dropdown button to make it more united with the whole website.
